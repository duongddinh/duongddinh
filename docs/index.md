## Square Design

_Minimalist but too minimalist_

Let's take a look at my website [null0verflow.xyz](https://null0verflow.xyz), we are going to discuss how i chose my design language.

**Color:** As a self taught designer, color choice was definately important in creating a website. I decided to use the same gradient of a color to keep the theme of each page more consistent; I use the opposite the color palatte and/or the same shade of the color. The color choice for each page (except the first) is completely random, representing the nature, everything tends to move toward randomness. The first page is my theme, black and white, which can be seen in my merch's website design [null0verflow.xyz/merch](https://null0verflow.xyz/merch).
I believe that the color choice for each page is easy on the eyes. You can check out the color theory to learn more.

**Square:** I have never seen anyone design website like this, almost _too_ minimalist. Is this the problem? There is not much content in each page, waste of space? Well, I can confidently say that I invented this design. Now, it might seem "too minimalist" to a point where it seems like there is something missing. But if you are like me, who is willing to sacrify everything for look, you will understand that this is not the case, however. Unless this is a static page where there is no interaction between the user and the page, this design is unique and breaks the norms.

The design on the first page "train" the user to use the website. It releases the curiosity in each shape where there is no label, which forces the user to hover on each shape to find out what each shape contains. You'll see throughout the site, evey shape is clickable. 

The second page conveys a sudden change in aesthetic, which set the mood for every page, people are more likely to continue to scroll down because they don't know what to expect. With smooth transition, scrolling is even more fun.

Each square delivers a different meanings. The first three squares contains three websites, my merch, discord bot, and older websites. Each of these has a similar design (black/white) and are for advertising hence, it is in the first page. Whereas the two squares in the second page represents the research i did in order to write the programs. Butterfly is the theme for the second page, beautiful and colorful of nature, perfectly introduce neural network and true random (which are two squares). My neural network program introduce the idea of microevolution and macroevolution which is illustrated as the bigger squares where part of it roots in true random (smaller squares). The bigger the squares, the more proud and important the products are.

**Font:** I use two fonts, one is the handwritting type of font and the other is the more classical font. The handwritting represents the playful, curiosity, and natural look in the design language, the other represent more of a formal look. Both connected illustates the convention, but unconventional look. 

**Inspiration/How I make the website:** I use google slides to design this before I code the whole website. I believe that even though the right tools play an important role in designing, with the right attitude and creativity, tools become less important. The idea of the website comes from mostly nature, the beauty and colorful of nature. Square brings the feel of stability, trustworthy, and honesty. 

**Why does this page exists?** Because I want to highlight the change and the growth in the way I design stuff. I want to believe that I also invented this design language.
